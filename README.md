# git

This POC project intends to try out the `manim` engine for building educational content.
Our first notion is a modular video documenting `git` in relation to `github`.

Rob's original thesis is "I get 98% of my safe backup value by knowing the 5-command recipe: 
`get clone / pull / add / commit / push`. Once I have these memorized and I've created a
couple GitHub repos: I'm back to the topic of interest and I never need to think about
`git` ever again, hurray."

...but there are directions to expand and further enhance one's workflow, broadly:

- What else can `git` do?
    - branches, pull requests, `stash`, `stash pop`, reconciling content, ...
- What else can `GitHub` do?
    - actions, pages, `hugo`, associated data volumes > 100MB, ...
